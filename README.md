# Coding Resource Finder
An easier way to find coding related topics and projects on the [ACN syllabus](http://syllabus.africacode.net/). Built with ReactJS and NodeJS.

## Problem
I like [ACN syllabus](http://syllabus.africacode.net/) and the people behind it. I go there whenever I want to learn something new to see if there are any relevant resources. It didn't have a way to easily search and bookmark resources. The default browser search(Ctrl+F) wasn't returning all the result and required clicking on parent links to search them. My browser bookmarks were not an option because I already have enough bookmarks and wanted them to be linked with the resources site.

## Tech stack
- **ReactJS** - for the frontend
- **Context** - global state management
- **React Router** - Internal routing
- [**JSDOM**](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) - web scraping
- **ExpressJS** - API development

## Challenges
- Getting the resources data without an API - Overcame this by learning web scraping, getting the data and creating an API to query the data in a less painful way. 

## Lessons learned
- Most sites have undocumented APIs that you can find by playing around with network dev tools. I learned about it too late.
- Scraping the web for specific data
- Develop and deploy React fronteds and NodeJS APIs
