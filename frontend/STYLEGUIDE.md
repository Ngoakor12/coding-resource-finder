# Style Guide

As an open-source codebase grows, different developers with differing approaches to problem-solving, software design and opinions will converge and attempt to push changes. When this happens, a universal guide for programming style will be needed to ensure a pattern is followed for easier-to-understand code. That is the purpose of this style guide covering the front-end code.

<h2 id='1'>React/JavaScript</h2>
<h3 id='1.1'>Basic Rules</h3>

- Follow the best practices contained in [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).
- Always use JSX syntax.
- Avoid classes and use Hooks to the best possible extent.
- All components should be inside a **descriptive** folder. If a component falls under an **existing** category, e.g Buttons, place its .js file in there. If an existing category doesn't exist, but you feel you can create one, create a descriptive category and use it in naming the folder. If it is impossible to create a category, name the folder the same as the component, e.g if you need to build a Tooltip.js component, you can place it in a folder named Tooltips.
- All styles should be defined in `App.css`.
- SVGs are treated as reusable components. All SVGs are & should be placed in `src/svgs.js.`
- Abstract component **logic** into Context as much as possible.
- Use `<React.Fragment />` syntax instead of `<>` when creating fragments. Doing otherwise might result in an error depending on how your workspace is set up if you use VSCode. We're working on getting rid of this restriction.
- Use ES6 syntax to the best of your ability.
- State the export type when defining the function and not after.

  ```javascript
  // don't do this
  function LiftWeights(){
    // do stuff
  }
  export default LiftWeights


  // do this instead
  export default function SleepAllDay(){
    // do stuff
  }
  ```

- Always use camelCase for prop names.
- Omit the value of the prop when it is explicitly true. There's no need for `primary={true}`, simply use `primary`

<h3 id='1.2'>Naming</h3>

- **File extensions**: Use the .js extension for React components and any utility functions.
- **Component file names**: Component file/folder names should follow the same PascalCase format as React components. Component/folder names should be as descriptive as possible. Avoid loose names like "AsyncComponent" that could encompass a variety of components. Instead, use specific names like ResourceDetailsMenu.js. Don't be afraid to use relatively long names within a reasonable limit (~22 chars).

<h3 id='1.3'>Quotes</h3>

Always use double quotes (").

```javascript
// bad 👎🏾
<Foo style='bar' />

// good 👍🏾
<Foo style="bar" />
```

<h3 id='1.4'>Spacing</h3>

- Always include a **single** space in your self-closing tag.

```javascript
// bad 👎🏾
<Foo/>

// also bad 👎🏾
<Foo                 />

// please don't do this 😑
<Foo
 />

// good 👍🏾
<Foo />
```

- Do not pad JSX curly braces with spaces.

```javascript
// bad 👎🏾
<Foo bar={ no } />

// good 👍🏾
<Foo bar={yes} />
```

<h3 id='1.5'>Tags</h3>

Always self-close tags that have no children.

```javascript
// bad 👎🏾
<Button variant="primary"></Button>

// good 👍🏾
<Button variant="secondary" />
```

Happy coding!
