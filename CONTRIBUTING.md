# Opening an issue

1. Search through the open issues and add one if you don't find it anything related.
2. Search through the closed/merged issues and if an issue you want to open has a merged PR, then reopen that issue with details on why you think the issue was not addressed.
3. Add labels related to your issue

# Opening a PR

1. Ask to work on an issue if you want to open a PR related to an issue, that way you can be assigned and others know you're working on it
2. Avoid opening a PR without an accompanying issue, so maybe open an issue to discuss if what you want to add to the project will be welcomed before you write complex features that may or may not be merged
3. Link issues related to your PR via the PR template or the development section on the right sidebar
